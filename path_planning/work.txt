Remarks: 
 Depending on the navigational purpose, harbour facilities are defined by: an area including docks, 
basins, and dockside equipment; or a point. 
 If it is required to encode a terminal with facilities to load/unload or store shipping containers, this 
should be done using HRBFAC with attribute CATHAF = 10 (container terminal). 
 If it is required to encode a covered terminal into which ships can go, this should be done using 
HRBFAC with the purpose of the terminal defined by CATHAF.  The roof of the terminal may be 
encoded using the attribute NATCON, and the maximum height and/or draught of vessels able to 
use the terminal encoded using the attribute INFORM.  Alternatively, the roofed structure may be 
encoded using a BUISGL object (see clause 4.8.15). 
4.6.2 
Berths (see S-4 – B-321, B-321.6-9 and B-410.1)

Remarks: 
 The berth encodes the named place where a vessel can be moored adjacent to a shoreline 
construction.  The shoreline construction itself should be encoded using the object class SLCONS 
(see clause 4.5.2). 
 Landing places for boats should be encoded as small craft facilities (see clause 4.6.5). 
4.6.3 
Harbour offices (see S-4 – B-325) 
If it is required to encode a harbour office, it must be done using the object class BUISGL (see clause 
4.8.15), with the attribute FUNCTN taking at least one of the values: 
 
2 - harbour-master’s office 
 
3 - custom office 
 
4 - health office 
 
11 - pilot office

Lighthouses (see S-4 – B-457.3) 
If it is required to encode a lighthouse, it must be done using a LNDMRK object (see clause 4.8.15), 
with attributes CATLMK = 17 (tower) and FUNCTN = 33 (light support) for towers, or using a BUISGL 
object (see clause 4.8.15), with the attribute FUNCTN = 33, for any other shapes. 
If it is required to encode the attributes ELEVAT, HEIGHT and VERLEN for a lighthouse, this must be 
done as described in clause 12.3.1. 
If the lighthouse is permanently extinguished/unlit, this must be indicated by population of the attribute 
STATUS = 4 (not in use) for the LNDMRK/BUISGL, and the LIGHTS object(s) must be removed.  
Where a lighthouse is illuminated by floodlights, the additional value of STATUS = 12 (illuminated) 
must also be populated.  For lights that are temporarily extinguished, see clause 2.6.2.2 – paragraph 
10(i).
